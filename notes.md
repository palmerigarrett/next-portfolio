# Notes

Plan going forward
1. Sidebar will serve as navigation
2. dropdowns like below:
```
- About Me
- Professional Experience
  - Wheels Up
  - PIN
- Tech Stack
- Go to Resume
```

3. when selecting leaf node, open page within viewport
4. Route should change with each section, but will not actually be routing
5. Should have some sort of scale effect
6. Open to about me page
7. apple scroll style sucks
8. I hate gsap
